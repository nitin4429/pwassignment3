    Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
    explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
    showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
    information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics
    on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
    discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
    designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes
    fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can
    also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families,
    weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy.
    Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
    ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and
    engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog,
    expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
    Material icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common
    communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital
    products for Android, iOS, and web.
